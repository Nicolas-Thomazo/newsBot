- environment (ocean, climat change, tornado ...)

## 📋 Explications

The architecture of newsBot fall into the task-oriented dialog system, it is designed for a particular task (here Job finder & Telling jokes). It's set up to get information from the user to help complete the task. Like the Control structure of Frame Based Dialogue System, it has a set of slots for the job frame that specifies what the system needs to know, then define the values that each slot can take by asking questions of each. Consider this very simple finite-state control architecture shown in the table below implementing a job finder system asking the user for the information for 3 slots: keyword, location and salary.
